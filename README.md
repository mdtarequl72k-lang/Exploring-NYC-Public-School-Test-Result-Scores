# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
## 📝 Project Overview
This is my DataCamp project. Every year, American high school students take the SAT—a standardized test with three sections: reading, math and writing (each up to 800 points). This project analyzes New York City public high school SAT results, giving insight for students, parents and education professionals.[1]

## 📊 Dataset

- **Rows:** 375 NYC public high schools
- **Columns:**  
  - `schoolname`: Name of school
  - `borough`: NYC borough
  - `averagemath`, `averagereading`, `averagewriting`: Subject mean scores
  - `percenttested`: Percent tested per school

## 🛠️ What’s Inside the Notebook?
- Data loading and preview 
- Exploratory analysis (means, percent tested) 
- Top 10 schools by math and total SAT score 
- SAT score statistics by borough
