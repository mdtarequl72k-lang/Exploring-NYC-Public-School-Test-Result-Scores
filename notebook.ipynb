There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nprint(schools.head())\nprint(schools.info())\nprint(schools.shape)\nprint(schools.describe())# Question 1: Best Math Schools - Filter schools with average_math >= 640 (80% of max 800 pts)","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":4032,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nprint(schools.head())\nprint(schools.info())\nprint(schools.shape)\nprint(schools.describe())","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1762463133125,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":511,"type":"stream"}},"visualizeDataframe":false,"chartConfig":{"bar":{"hasRoundedCorners":true,"stacked":false},"type":"bar","version":"v1"},"lastExecutedByKernel":"f7e32734-8084-4fc1-ba6f-6bf34e8fadb3"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"                                         school_name  ... percent_tested\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...  ...
